Hi, I'm Feross Aboukhadijeh and this is my blog's source code. Visit my live blog at [http://feross.org](http://feross.org).

## How it's built

All my posts are written in Markdown and compiled with [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) when I deploy. I host it on my own server since I like being in control of my data (seriously, being a [sharecropper](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/12/WebsThePlace) sucks).

Feel free to browse the source, fork, and [ask me questions](http://twitter.com/FreeTheFeross). Sharing your code is awesome, and you should do the same.

## The design

If you decided to fork, please create your own blog design. Unlike most of my other code, I'm not MIT licensing this code because I don't want to see fifty other blogs using my design. So, learn some CSS and make your own. It won't kill you, I promise.
