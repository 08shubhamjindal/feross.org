  // ]]></script></a>&gt; is a computer security researcher, teacher, web developer, designer, long distance runner, gamer, music lover, and builder of websites that (sometimes) go viral.

  Feross specializes in web development -- specifically, high-level programming languages, browsers, and web framework design. He's also fascinated by the human brain, psychology, online education, the quantified self movement, and (more recently) augmented reality, and wearable computers.

  Feross has worked at <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a>, and has done research in the Stanford <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/">human-computer interaction</a> and <a href="http://seclab.stanford.edu/">computer security</a> labs. He spent 5 quarters teaching computer science to new CS students in Stanford's <a href="http://cs198.stanford.edu">CS 198</a> program, and has organized dozens of computing-related events as president of Stanford's <a href="http://stanfordacm.com">Association for Computing Machinery</a> chapter.

  In September 2010, Feross built <a href="http://ytinstant.com">YouTube Instant</a>, a realtime YouTube search engine, in just 3 hours as a bet with his roommate. The site garnered immediate worldwide media attention -- 1 million visitors in 10 days, and hundreds of news stories. YouTube's then-CEO, Chad Hurley, was so impressed after using the site, that he immediately offered Feross a job at YouTube.

  Feross is 21 years old (that is [age]!), attends <a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> (graduating this June), and lives in Palo Alto, CA.
